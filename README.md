```
git clone --recursive git://github.com/jcemer/geo-colony
```

2. Rename file `/fuel/app/config/db.example.php` to `/fuel/app/config/db.php` and set up MySQL database credentials.

3. Put the `public` folder in your public interface (a.k.a. `public_html` or just `public`). The others folders can stand hidden from external access.

Run `npm install` to install node modules used to compile the assets.

Use `cake build` to compile the `assets` folder content to `public/assets`. You can also run `cake watch` and `cake dev watch` to live recompile the files.
